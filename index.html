        <header>HAPPY BIRTHDAY D3 !</header>
        <p>
            Ever since I started to learn D3.js I have bookmarked all the resources I have used for every project. This data visualization is a timeline and radial tidy tree of each project and the respective resources used.
            In a span of one year I have made projects using D3 version 4,5,6 and this could not be possible without all the examples available on Bl.ocks, Observable, Stackoverflow and other personal blogs.
            Thank you to every person who has provided code examples. You've helped flatten the "steep learning curve" that D3.js is associated with.
